# About

I\'m William (Firstyear), a software engineer in Brisbane, Australia.
I\'m part of the [389 Directory Server](http://www.port389.org) team,
working for SUSE Labs. I\'m always happy to talk LDAP and programming,
and am very happy to help out with your issues and queries.

I can be contacted about entries on my blog at william at blackhats dot
net dot au. If there is anything you would like to see on this blog, I\'d
be happy to hear from you.

Happy reading!
