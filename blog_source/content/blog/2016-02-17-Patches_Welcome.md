# \"Patches Welcome\"

\"Patches Welcome\". We\'ve all seen it in the Open Source community.
Nothing makes me angrier than these two words.

Often this is said by people who are too busy, or too lazy to implement
features that just aren\'t of interest to them. This isn\'t the response
you get when you submit a bad idea, or something technically unfeasible.
It\'s the response that speaks of an apathy to your software\'s users.

I get that we all have time limits for development. I know that we have
to prioritise. I know that it may not be of import to the business right
now. Even at the least, reach out, say you\'ll create a ticket on their
behalf if they cannot. Help them work through the design, then implement
it in the future.

But do not ever consider yourself so high and mighty that the request of
a user \"isn\'t good enough for you\". These are your customers,
supporters, advocates, bug reporters, testers, and users. They are what
build the community. A community is not just the developers of the
software. It\'s the users of it too, and their skills are separate from
those of the the developer.

Often people ask for features, but do not have the expertise, or domain
knowledge to implement them. That does not invalidate the worth of the
feature, if anything speaks to it\'s value as a real customer will
benefit from this, and your project as a whole will improve. Telling
them \"Patches Welcome\" is like saying \"I know you aren\'t capable of
implementing this yourself. I don\'t care to help you at all, and I
don\'t want to waste my time on you. Go away\".

As is obvious from this blog, I\'m part of the 389 Directory Server
Team.

I will *never* tell a user that \"patches welcome\". I will always
support them to design their idea. I will ask them to lodge a ticket, or
I\'ll do it for them if they cannot. If a user can and wants to try to
implement the software of their choice, I will help them and teach them.
If they cannot, I will make sure that at some time in the future, we can
deliver it to them, or if we cannot, a real, honest explanation of why.

That\'s the community in 389 I am proud to be a part of.
