# Zero Outage Migration Of Directory Server Infrastructure

In my previous job I used to manage the Directory Servers for a
University. People used to challenge me that while doing migrations,
downtime was needed.

*They are all wrong*

It is very possible, and achievable to have zero outage migrations of
Directory Servers. All it takes is some thought, planning, dedication
and testing.
