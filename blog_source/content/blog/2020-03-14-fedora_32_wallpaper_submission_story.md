# Fedora 32 Wallpaper Submission - Story

Fedora opens submissions for
[wallpapers](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/nuancier/contribute/) to be
submitted for the next version of the release. I used fedora for a long
time, so I decided to submit this photo, and write this post to talk
about it:

This was takeing on 2019-11-19 in my home city of Adelaide, South
Australia. I had traveled to see some friends over Christmas. We went to
[Mount
Osmond](https://www.google.com/maps/@-34.9656653,138.6670176,14.51z) to
take some photos, and I took this as we walked up to the lookout.

The next day, this area was a high risk location for a possible
bushfire - and many bushfires have since devastated many regions of
Australia, affecting many people that I know.

I really find that the Australian landscape is so different to Europe or
Asia - many tones of subtle reds, browns, and more. A dry and dusty
look. The palette is such a contrast to the lush greens of Europe.
Australia is a really beautiful country, in a very distinct and striking
manner.

Anyway, I hope you like the photo :)
