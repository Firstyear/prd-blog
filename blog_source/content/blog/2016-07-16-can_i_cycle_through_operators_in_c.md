# Can I cycle through operators in C?

A friend of mine who is learning to program asked me the following:

*\"\"\" How do i cycle through operators in c? If I want to try every
version of + -* / on an equation, so printf(\"1 %operator 1\",
oneOfTheOperators); Like I\'d stick them in an array and iterate over
the array incrementing on each iteration, but do you define an operator
as? They aren\'t ints, floats etc \"\"\"\*

He\'s certainly on the way to the correct answer already. There are
three key barriers to an answer.
