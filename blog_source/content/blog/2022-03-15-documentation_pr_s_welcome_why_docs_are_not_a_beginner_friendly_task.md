# Documentation PR\'s Welcome - Why Docs Are Not A Beginner Friendly Task

Recently I was reporting a usability issue with a library, mainly
related to it\'s confusing or absent documentation. A friend of mine saw
the exchange and commented (quite accurately) that it went along the
lines of:

-   Me: This library should improve it\'s documentation
-   Project: PR\'s welcome
-   Me: I can\'t write the docs because I don\'t know how this works
    without documentation

My friend also commented *\"\[this\] is probably the realest interaction
I've seen in a while.\"* and *\"It kinda shakes up the idea that if
people want something in OSS they should do it themselves, and that docs
are the easiest way to contribute\"*.

I completely agree with these observations.

Documentation writing is not a task for a drive by contributor, or a
beginner. Documentation writing is a skill in and of itself, that
requires many things. From my perspective, I believe documentation
writing requires:

-   Linguistic ability - to express ideas clearly to a diverse audience
    of readers.
-   Emotional intelligence - to empathise with their audience and to
    think \"what would help them in these words\"?
-   Technical knowledge - the understanding of the problem space to know
    how to write the correct documentation.

Generally, when someone is a beginner to a project they lack an
understanding of the project audience so they aren\'t able to empathise
with \"what could be useful for a reader\". They also tend to lack the
depth and breath of technical knowledge to know *what* to write for the
documentation since by definition, they are a newcommer to this project.

A great way to connect with a beginner is to listen to their
frustrations and what challenges the encountered with your project.
First, connect how that frustration could be either a failing of the
user interface and it\'s design (even an API is a user interface).
Second, only once you have eliminated design limitations, then consider
it to be a documentation problem. As the project contributor, you are in
a better position to write documentation than a beginner.

Telling someone, especially a beginner, \"docs PR\'s welcome\" is both
belitting to the skill that is technical writing, but also generally
considered in opensource to mean \"I don\'t give a shit about your
problem, fuck off\".
