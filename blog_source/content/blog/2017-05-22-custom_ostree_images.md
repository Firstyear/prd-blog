# Custom OSTree images

[Project Atomic](https://www.projectatomic.io/) is in my view, one of
the most promising changes to come to linux distributions in a long
time. It boasts the ability to atomicupgrade and alter your OS by
maintaining A/B roots of the filesystem. It is currently focused on
docker and k8s runtimes, but we can use atomic in other locations.
