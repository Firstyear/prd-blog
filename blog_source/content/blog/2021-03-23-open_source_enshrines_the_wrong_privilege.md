# Open Source Enshrines the Wrong Privilege

Within Open Source/Free Software, we repeatedly see a set of
behaviours - hostile or toxic project owners, abusive relationships,
aggression towards users, and complete disregard to users of the
software. Some projects have risen above this and advanced the social
behaviours in their communities, but these are still the minority of
projects.

Many advocates for FLOSS have been trying to enhance adoption of these
technologies in communities, but with the exception of limited
non-technical audiences, this really hasn\'t gained much ground.

It is my opinion that these community behaviours, and the low adoption
of FLOSS technologies comes back to what our Open Source licenses
enshrine - the very thing they embody and create.

## The Origins of Free Software

The story of Free Software starts with an individual (later revealed as
abusive), who was frustrated at not being able to access software on a
printer so that he could alter it\'s behaviour. This has been extended
to the idea that Free Software \"grants people control over their own
lives and software\".

This however, is not correct.

What Free Software licenses protect is that individuals with time,
resources, specialised technical knowledge and social standing have the
possibility to alter that software\'s behaviour.

When we consider that the majority of the world are not developers or
software engineers, what is it that our Free Software is doing to
protect and support these individuals? Should we truly expect
individuals who are linguists, authors, scientists, retail staff, or
social workers to be able to \"alter the software to fix their own
problems\"?

Even as technical experts, we are frustrated when someone closes an
issue with \"PR\'s welcome\". Imagine how these other people feel when
they can\'t even express or report the problem in the first place or get
told they aren\'t good enough, or that \"they can fix it themselves if
they want\".

This attitude also discounts the subject matter knowledge required to
alter or contribute to any piece of software however. I may be a Senior
Software Engineer, but I lack the knowledge and time to contribute to
Gnome for example. Even with these \"freedoms\" I lack the ability to
\"control\" the software on my own system.

## Open Source is Selfish

These licenses that we have in FLOSS all enshrine selfish and privileged
behaviours.

**I** have the rights to freely access this code so **I** can read it or
alter it.

**I** can change this project to fix issues **I** have.

**I** have freedoms.

None of these statements from FLOSS describe other people - the people
who consume our software (in some cases, without choice). People who are
not subject matter experts and can\'t contribute to \"solve their own
problems\". People who may not have the experience and language to
describe the problems they face.

This lack of empathy, the lack of concern for others in FLOSS leads us
to where we are now. Those who have the subject matter knowledge lead
projects, and do what *they* want because *they* can fix it. They tell
others \"PR\'s welcome\" knowing full-well that the other person may
never be able to contribute, that the barriers to contribution are so
high (both in programming experience and domain knowledge). They design
the software to work the way they want, because they understand it and
it \"works for me\".

This is reflected in our software. Software that not does not care for
the needs, experiences or rights of others. Software that pretends to be
accessible, all while creating gated communities of control. Software
that is out of reach of people, the same people that we \"claim\" to be
working for and supporting.

It leads to our communities that are selfish, and do not empathise with
people. Communities that have placed negative behaviours on pedestals
and turned these people into \"leaders\". Software that does not account
for the experiences of our users, believing that the \"community knows
best\".

One does not need to look far for FLOSS projects that speak one set of
words, but their actions do not align.

## What Can We Do?

In our projects we need to go beyond preserving the freedoms of
ourselves, and begin to discuss the freedoms and interactions that
others should have with our systems and projects. Here are some starting
ideas that I have:

-   Have a code of conduct for all contributors (remember, opening an
    issue is a contribution).
-   Document your target users, and what kind of experience they should
    have. Expand this over time.
-   Promote empathy for those who aren\'t direct contributors - indirect
    users without choice exist.
-   Remove dependencies on as many problematic software projects as
    possible.
-   Push for improvements to open licenses that enshrine the freedoms of
    others - not just developers.

As individual communities we can advance the state of software and how
we act socially so that future projects and users are in a better place.
No software exists in a vacuum, all software exists to support people.
We need to always keep in mind the effects our software has on others.
