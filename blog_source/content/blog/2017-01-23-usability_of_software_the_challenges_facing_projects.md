# Usability of software: The challenges facing projects

I have always desired the usability of software like Directory Server to
improve. As a former system administrator, usabilty and documentation
are very important for me. Improvements to usability can eliminate load
on documentation, support services and more.

Consider a microwave. No one reads the user manual. They unbox it, plug
it in, and turn it on. You punch in a time and expect it to \"make cold
things hot\". You only consult the manual if it blows up.

Many of these principles are rooted in the field of design. Design is an
important and often over looked part of software development - All the
way from the design of an API to the configuration, and even the user
interface of software.
