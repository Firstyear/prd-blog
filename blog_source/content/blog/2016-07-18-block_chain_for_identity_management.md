# Block Chain for Identity Management

On Sunday evening I was posed with a question and view of someone
interested in Block Chain.

*\"What do you think of block chain for authentication\"*

A very heated debate ensued. I want to discuss this topic at length.

We\'ve heard this. \"When writing cryptography, don\'t. If you have to,
hire a cryptographer\".

*This statement is true for Authentication and Authorisation systems*

\"When writing Authentication and Authorisation systems, don\'t. If you
have to, hire an Authentication expert\".

Guess what. Authentication and Authorisation are *hard*. Very hard. This
is not something for the kids to play with; this is a security critical,
business critical, sensitive, scrutinised and highly conservative area
of technology.
