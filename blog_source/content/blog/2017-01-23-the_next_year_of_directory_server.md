# The next year of Directory Server

Last year I wrote a post about the vision behind Directory Server and
what I wanted to achieve in the project personally. My key aims were:

-   We need to modernise our tooling, and installers.
-   Setting up replication groups and masters needs to be simpler.
-   We need to get away from long lived static masters.
-   During updates, we need to start to enable smarter choices by
    default.
-   Out of the box we need smarter settings.
-   Web Based authentication
