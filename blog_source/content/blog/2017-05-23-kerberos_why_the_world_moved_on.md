# Kerberos - why the world moved on

For a long time I have tried to integrate and improve authentication
technologies in my own environments. I have advocated the use of GSSAPI,
IPA, AD, and others. However, the more I have learnt, the further I have
seen the world moving away. I want to explore some of my personal
experiences and views as to why this occured, and what we can do.
