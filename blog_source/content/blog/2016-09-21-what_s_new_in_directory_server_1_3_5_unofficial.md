# What\'s new in 389 Directory Server 1.3.5 (unofficial)

As a member of the 389 Directory Server (389DS) core team, I am always
excited about our new releases. We have some really great features in
1.3.5. However, our changelogs are always large so I want to just touch
on a few of my favourites.

389 Directory Server is an LDAPv3 compliant server, used around the
world for Identity Management, Authentication, Authorisation and much
more. It is the foundation of the FreeIPA project\'s server. As a
result, it\'s not something we often think about or even get excited
for: but every day many of us rely on 389 Directory Server to be
correct, secure and fast behind the scenes.
