        <h1 id="ldap-guide-part-1-foundations">LDAP Guide Part 1: Foundations</h1>
<p>To understand LDAP we must understand a number of concepts of
datastructures: Specifically graphs.</p>
<h2 id="undirected">Undirected</h2>
<p>In computer science, a set of nodes, connected by some set of edges is
called a graph. Here we can see a basic example of a graph.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/graph-basic-1.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Viewing this graph, we can see that it has a number of properties. It
has 4 nodes, and 4 edges. As this is undirected we can assume the link A
to B is as valid as B to A.</p>
<p>We also have a cycle: That is a loop between nodes. We can see this in
B, C, D. If any edge between the set of B, D or B, C, or C, D were
removed, this graph would no longer have cycles.</p>
<h2 id="directed">Directed</h2>
<p>A directed graph is where each edge not only defines a link between two
nodes, but also the direction of the link. For example, we can see that
A to B is a valid edge, but B to A is not. We would say that the node
where the link is from is the outgoing node of the edge. Where the node
recieves an egde, IE the arrow, is an incoming edge.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/graph-basic-2.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>In this graph, for a cycle to occur, we must have a set of nodes where
not only the edges exist, but the direction allows a loop. Here, the
cycle is B, C, D. Were the link between C and D reversed, we no longer
have a cycle in our directed graph.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/graph-basic-3.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<h2 id="trees">Trees</h2>
<p>A tree is a special case of the directed graph. The properties of a tree
are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each node has 1 and only 1 incoming edge.</li>
<li>The graph may have no cycles.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a tree is below. You can check and it maintains all the
properties above. Note there is no limit to outbound edges, the only
rule is maximum of one incoming.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/graph-basic-4.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>A property that you regularly see is that nodes are unique in a tree, IE
A will not appear twice. This allows for <em>searching</em> of the tree.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-nodes">More on nodes</h2>
<p>So far our nodes have been a bit bland. We can do more with them though.
Instead of just storing a single datum in them, we can instead store the
datum as a key to lookup the node, and then have more complex data in
the value of the node. For example, we can expand our tree to look like
this:</p>
<p><img src="/_static/graph-basic-5.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>This is why having unique keys in our nodes is important. It allows us
to search the tree for that node, and to retrieve the data stored
within.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-ldap-look-like">What does LDAP look like</h2>
<p>LDAP is a tree of objects. Each object has a name, or an RDN (Relative
Distinguished Name). The object itself has many key: value pairs in
it's data field. If we visualise this, it looks like this.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/graph-basic-6.svg" alt="image" /></p>
<p>We have the RDN (our tree node's key value), displayed by type=value,
and then a set of attributes (the data of the node).</p>
<h2 id="naming-things">Naming things</h2>
<p>With LDAP often we want to directly reference an node in the tree. To do
so, we need a way to uniquely reference the nodes as they exist.</p>
<p>Unlike our example trees, where each key is likely to be unique. IE node
with key A is cannot exist twice in the tree. In ldap it <em>is</em> valid to
have a key exist twice, such as ou=People. This raises a challenge.
Previously, we could just &quot;look for A&quot;, and we would have what we
wanted. But now, we must not only know the RDN, aka key, that we want to
retrieve, but the path through the tree from the root to our target node
with the RDN.</p>
<p>This is done by walking down the tree til we find what we want. Looking
at the image above, consider:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>dc=com
</span><span>dc=example,dc=com
</span><span>ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
</span><span>uid=user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can make a Fully Qualified Distinguished Name (FQDN), or just
Distinguished Name(DN), by joining the RDN components. For our example,
uid=user,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com. This is a unique path through the
tree to the node we wish to access.</p>
<p>This should explain why LDAP is called a &quot;tree&quot;, why objects are named
the way they are, and help you to visualise the layout of data in your
own tree.</p>
