        <h1 id="docker-buildx-for-multiarch-builds">docker buildx for multiarch builds</h1>
<p>I have been previously building Kanidm with plain docker build, but
recently a community member wanted to be able to run kanidm on arm64.
That meant that I needed to go down the rabbit hole of how to make this
work ...</p>
<h2 id="what-not-to-do">What not to do ...</h2>
<p>There is a previous method of using manifest files to allow multiarch
uploads. It's pretty messy but it works, so this is an option if you
want to investigate but I didn't want to pursue it.</p>
<p>Bulidx exists and I got it working on my linux machine with the steps
from
<a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/getting-started-with-docker-for-arm-on-linux/">here</a>
but the build took more than 3 hours, so I don't recommend it if you
plan to do anything intense or frequently.</p>
<h2 id="buildx-cluster">Buildx cluster</h2>
<p>Docker has a cross-platform building toolkit called buildx which is
currently tucked into the experimental features. It can be enabled on
docker for mac in the settings (note: you only need experimental support
on the coordinating machine aka your workstation).</p>
<p>Rather than follow the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/">official
docs</a> this will
branch out. The reason is that buildx in the official docs uses
qemu-aarch64 translation which is very slow and energy hungry, taking a
long time to produce builds. As mentioned already I was seeing in excess
of 3 hours for aarch64 on my builder VM or my mac.</p>
<p>Instead, in this configuration I will use my mac as a coordinator, and
an x86_64 VM and a rock64pro as builder nodes, so that the builds are
performed on native architecture machines.</p>
<p>First we need to configure our nodes. In
[/etc/docker/daemon.json]{.title-ref} we need to expose our docker
socket to our mac. I have done this with the following:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>{
</span><span>  &quot;hosts&quot;: [&quot;unix:///var/run/docker.sock&quot;, &quot;tcp://0.0.0.0:2376&quot;]
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p><em>WARNING</em>: This configuration is HIGHLY INSECURE. This exposes your
docker socket to the network with no authentication, which is equivalent
to un-authenticated root access. I have done this because my builder
nodes are on an isolated and authenticated VLAN of my home network. You
should either do similar or use TLS authentication.</p>
<p>NOTE: The [ssh://]{.title-ref} transport does not work for docker
buildx. No idea why but it don't.</p>
<p>Once this is done restart docker on the two builder nodes.</p>
<p>Now we can configure our coordinator machine. We need to check buildx is
present:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>docker buildx --help
</span></code></pre>
<p>We then want to create a new builder instance and join our nodes to it.
We can use the DOCKER_HOST environment variable for this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>DOCKER_HOST=tcp://x.x.x.x:2376 docker buildx create --name cluster
</span><span>DOCKER_HOST=tcp://x.x.x.x:2376 docker buildx create --name cluster --append
</span></code></pre>
<p>We can then startup and bootstrap the required components with:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>docker buildx use cluster
</span><span>docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
</span></code></pre>
<p>We should see output like:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>Name:   cluster
</span><span>Driver: docker-container
</span><span>
</span><span>Nodes:
</span><span>Name:      cluster0
</span><span>Endpoint:  tcp://...
</span><span>Status:    running
</span><span>Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/386
</span><span>
</span><span>Name:      cluster1
</span><span>Endpoint:  tcp://...
</span><span>Status:    running
</span><span>Platforms: linux/arm64, linux/arm/v7, linux/arm/v6
</span></code></pre>
<p>If we are happy with this we can make this the default builder.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>docker buildx use cluster --default
</span></code></pre>
<p>And you can now use it to build your images such as:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>docker buildx build --push --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -f Dockerfile -t &lt;tag&gt; .
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now I can build my multiarch images much quicker and efficently!</p>
