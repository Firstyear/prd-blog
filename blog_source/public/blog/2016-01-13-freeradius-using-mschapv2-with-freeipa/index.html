<p><a href="/blog/html/2019/07/10/i_no_longer_recommend_freeipa.html">I no longer recommend using FreeIPA - Read more
here!</a></p>
<p>Wireless and radius is pretty much useless without mschapv2 and peap.
This is because iPhones, androids, even linux have fundamental issues
with ttls or other 802.1x modes. mschapv2 &quot;just works&quot;, yet it's one
of the most obscure to get working in some cases without AD.</p>
<p>If you have an active directory environment, it's pretty well a
painless process. But when you want to use anything else, you are in a
tight spot.</p>
<p>The FreeRADIUS team go on <em>a lot</em> about how mschapv2 doesn't work with
ldap: and they are correct. mschapv2 is a challenge response protocol,
and you can't do that in conjunction with an ldap bind.</p>
<p>However it <em>IS</em> possible to use mschapv2 with an ldap server: It's just
not obvious or straight forwards.</p>
<p>The way that this works is you need freeradius to look up a user to an
ldap dn, then you read (not bind) the nthash of the user from their dn.
From there, the FreeRADIUS server is able to conduct the challenge
response component.</p>
<p>So the main things here to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>nthash are pretty much an md4. They are broken and terrible. But you
need to use them, so you need to secure the access to these.</li>
<li>Because you need to secure these, you need to be sure your access
controls are correct.</li>
</ul>
<p>We can pretty easily make this setup work with freeipa in fact.</p>
<p>First, follow the contents of <a href="/blog/html/2015/07/06/FreeIPA:_Giving_permissions_to_service_accounts..html">my previous blog
post</a>
on how to setup the adtrust components and the access controls.</p>
<p>You don't actually need to complete the trust with AD, you just need to
run the setup util, as this triggers IPA to generate and store nthashes
in ipaNTHash on the user account.</p>
<p>Now armed with your service account that can read these hashes, and the
password, we need to configure FreeRADIUS.</p>
<p>FreeRADIUS is EXTREMELY HARD TO CONFIGURE. You can mess it up VERY
QUICKLY.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the developers provide an excellent default configuration
that should only need minimal tweaks to make this configuration work.</p>
<p>first, symlink ldap to mods-enabled</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>cd /etc/raddb/mods-enabled
</span><span>ln -s ../mods-available/ldap ./ldap
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, edit the ldap config in mods-available (That way if a swap file is
made, it's not put into mods-enabled where it may do damage)</p>
<p>You need to change the parameters to match your site, however the most
important setting is:</p>
<p>:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>identity = krbprincipalname=radius/host.ipa.example.net.au@IPA.EXAMPLE.NET.AU,cn=services,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=example,dc=net,dc=au
</span><span>password = SERVICE ACCOUNT BIND PW
</span><span>
</span><span>....snip.....
</span><span>
</span><span>update {
</span><span>      ....snip......
</span><span>      control:NT-Password··   := &#39;ipaNTHash&#39;
</span><span>}
</span><span>
</span><span> .....snip ....
</span><span>
</span><span>user {
</span><span>       base_dn = &quot;cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=ipa,dc=example,dc=net,dc=au&quot;
</span><span>       filter = &quot;(uid=%{%{Stripped-User-Name}:-%{User-Name}})&quot;
</span><span>        ....snip....
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, you want to edit the mods-available/eap</p>
<p>you want to change the value of default_eap_type to:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>default_eap_type = mschapv2
</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, you need to update your sites-available, most likely
inner-tunnel and default to make sure that they contain:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>authorize {
</span><span>
</span><span>      ....snip .....
</span><span>      -ldap
</span><span>
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>That's it! Now you should be able to test an ldap account with radtest,
using the default NAS configured in /etc/raddb/clients.conf.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>radtest -t mschap william password 127.0.0.1:1812 0 testing123
</span><span>    User-Name = &#39;william&#39;
</span><span>    NAS-IP-Address = 172.24.16.13
</span><span>    NAS-Port = 0
</span><span>    Message-Authenticator = 0x00
</span><span>    MS-CHAP-Challenge = 0x642690f62148e238
</span><span>        MS-CHAP-Response = ....
</span><span>Received Access-Accept Id 130 from 127.0.0.1:1812 to 127.0.0.1:56617 length 84
</span><span>    MS-CHAP-MPPE-Keys = 0x
</span><span>    MS-MPPE-Encryption-Policy = Encryption-Allowed
</span><span>    MS-MPPE-Encryption-Types = RC4-40or128-bit-Allowed
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="why-not-use-krb">Why not use KRB?</h2>
<p>I was asked in IRC about using KRB keytabs for authenticating the
service account. Now the configuration is quite easy - but I won't put
it hear.</p>
<p>The issue is that it opens up a number of weaknesses. Between FreeRADIUS
and LDAP you have communication. Now FreeIPA/389DS doesn't allow GSSAPI
over LDAPS/StartTLS. When you are doing an MSCHAPv2 authentication this
isn't so bad: FreeRADIUS authenticates with GSSAPI with encryption
layers, then reads the NTHash. The NTHash is used inside FreeRADIUS to
generate the challenge, and the 802.1x authentication suceeds or fails.</p>
<p>Now what happens when we use PAP instead? FreeRADIUS can either read the
NTHash and do a comparison (as above), or it can <em>directly bind</em> to the
LDAP server. This means in the direct bind case, that the transport <em>may
not be encrypted</em> due to the keytab. See, the keytab when used for the
service account, will install encryption, but when the simple bind
occurs, we don't have GSSAPI material, so we would send this clear
text.</p>
<p>Which one will occur ... Who knows! FreeRADIUS is a complex piece of
software, as is LDAP. Unless you are willing to test all the different
possibilities of 802.1x types and LDAP interactions, there is a risk
here.</p>
<p>Today the only secure, guaranteed way to protect your accounts is TLS.
You should use LDAPS, and this guarantees all communication will be
secure. It's simpler, faster, and better.</p>
<p>That's why I don't document or advise how to use krb keytabs with this
configuration.</p>
<p>Thanks to <em>moep</em> for helping point out some of the issues with KRB
integration.</p>
