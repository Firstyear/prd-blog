        <h1 id="implementing-webauthn-a-series-of-complexities">Implementing Webauthn - a series of complexities ...</h1>
<p>I have recently started to work on a rust webauthn library, to allow
servers to be implemented. However, in this process I have noticed a few
complexities to an API that should have so much promise for improving
the state of authentication. So far I can say I have not found any
cryptographic issues, but the design of the standard does raise
questions about the ability for people to correctly implement Webauthn
servers.</p>
<h2 id="odd-structure-decisions">Odd structure decisions</h2>
<p>Webauth is made up of multiple encoding standards. There is a good
reason for this, which is that the json parts are for the webbrowser,
and the cbor parts are for ctap and the authenticator device.</p>
<p>However, I quickly noticed an issue in the Attestation Object, as
described here <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-attestation">https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-attestation</a> . Can
you see the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that the Authenticator Data relies on hand-parsing bytes,
and has two structures that are concatenated with no length. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have to hand parse bytes 0 -&gt; 36</li>
<li>You then have to CBOR deserialise the Attested Cred Data (if
present)</li>
<li>You then need to serialise the ACD back to bytes and record that
length (if your library doesn't tell you how long the amount of
data is parsed was).</li>
<li>Then you need to CBOR deserialise the Extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's more insulting about this situation is that the Authenticator
Data literally is part of the AttestationObject which is already
provided as CBOR! There seems to be no obvious reason for this to
require hand-parsing, as the Authenticator Data which will be signature
checked, has it's byte form checked, so you could have the
AttestationObject store authDataBytes, then you can CBOR decode the
nested structure (allowing the hashing of the bytes later).</p>
<p>There are many risks here because now you have requirements to length
check all the parameters which people could get wrong - when CBOR would
handle this correctly for you you and provides a good level of
correctness that the structure is altered. I also trust the CBOR parser
authors to do proper length checks too compared to my crappy byte
parsing code!</p>
<h2 id="confusing-naming-conventions-and-layout">Confusing Naming Conventions and Layout</h2>
<p>The entire standard is full of various names and structures, which are
complex, arbitrarily nested and hard to see why they are designed this
way. Perhaps it's a legacy compatability issue? More likely I think
it's object-oriented programming leaking into the specification, which
is a paradigm that is not universally applicable.</p>
<p>Regardless, it would be good if the structures were flatter, and named
better. There are many confusing structure names throughout the
standard, and it can sometimes be hard to identify what you require and
don't require.</p>
<p>Additionally, naming of fields and their use, uses abbrivations to save
bandwidth, but makes it hard to follow. I did honestly get confused
about the difference between rp (the relying party name) and rp_id,
where the challenge provides rp, and the browser response use rp_id.</p>
<p>It can be easy to point fingers and say &quot;ohh William, you're just not
reading it properly and are stupid&quot;. Am I? Or is it that humans find it
really hard to parse data like this, and our brains are better suited to
other tasks? Human factors are important to consider in specification
design both in naming of values, consistency of their use, and
appropriate communication as to how they are used properly. I'm finding
this to be a barrier to correct implementation now (especially as the
signature verification section is very fragmented and hard to follow
...).</p>
<h2 id="crypto-steps-seem-complex-or-too-static">Crypto Steps seem complex or too static</h2>
<p>There are a lot of possible choices here - there are 6 attestation
formats and 5 attestation types. As some formats only do some types,
there are then 11 verification paths you need to implement for all
possible authenticators. I think this level of complexity will lead to
mistakes over a large number of possible code branch paths, or lacking
support for some device types which people may not have access to.</p>
<p>I think it may have been better to limit the attestation format to one,
well defined format, and within that to limit the attestation types
available to suit a more broad range of uses.</p>
<p>It feels a lot like these choice are part of some internal
Google/MS/Other internal decisions for high security devices, or custom
deviges, which will be internally used. It's leaked into the spec and
it raises questions about the ability for people to meaningfully
implement the full specification for all possible devices, let alone
correctly.</p>
<p>Some parts even omit details in a cryptographic operation, such as
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#fido-u2f-attestation">here</a> in
verification step 2, it doesn't even list what format the bytes are.
(Hint: it's DER x509).</p>
<h2 id="what-would-i-change">What would I change?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be more specific</li>
</ul>
<p>There should be no assumptions about format types, what is in bytes. Be
verbose, detailed and without ambiguity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use type safe, length checked structures.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would probably make the entire thing a single CBOR structure which
contains other nested structures as required. We should never have to
hand-parse bytes in 2019, especially when there is a great deal of
evidence to show the risks of expecting people to do this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't assume object orientation</li>
</ul>
<p>I think simpler, flatter structures in the json/cbor would have helped,
and been clearer to implement, rather than the really complex maze of
types currently involved.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Despite these concerns, I still think webauthn is a really good
standard, and I really do think it will become the future of
authentication. I'm hoping to help make that a reality in opensource
and I hope that in the future I can contribute to further development
and promotion of webauthn.</p>
