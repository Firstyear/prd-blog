        <h1 id="documentation-pr-s-welcome-why-docs-are-not-a-beginner-friendly-task">Documentation PR's Welcome - Why Docs Are Not A Beginner Friendly Task</h1>
<p>Recently I was reporting a usability issue with a library, mainly
related to it's confusing or absent documentation. A friend of mine saw
the exchange and commented (quite accurately) that it went along the
lines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Me: This library should improve it's documentation</li>
<li>Project: PR's welcome</li>
<li>Me: I can't write the docs because I don't know how this works
without documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>My friend also commented <em>&quot;[this] is probably the realest interaction
I've seen in a while.&quot;</em> and <em>&quot;It kinda shakes up the idea that if
people want something in OSS they should do it themselves, and that docs
are the easiest way to contribute&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>I completely agree with these observations.</p>
<p>Documentation writing is not a task for a drive by contributor, or a
beginner. Documentation writing is a skill in and of itself, that
requires many things. From my perspective, I believe documentation
writing requires:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linguistic ability - to express ideas clearly to a diverse audience
of readers.</li>
<li>Emotional intelligence - to empathise with their audience and to
think &quot;what would help them in these words&quot;?</li>
<li>Technical knowledge - the understanding of the problem space to know
how to write the correct documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, when someone is a beginner to a project they lack an
understanding of the project audience so they aren't able to empathise
with &quot;what could be useful for a reader&quot;. They also tend to lack the
depth and breath of technical knowledge to know <em>what</em> to write for the
documentation since by definition, they are a newcommer to this project.</p>
<p>A great way to connect with a beginner is to listen to their
frustrations and what challenges the encountered with your project.
First, connect how that frustration could be either a failing of the
user interface and it's design (even an API is a user interface).
Second, only once you have eliminated design limitations, then consider
it to be a documentation problem. As the project contributor, you are in
a better position to write documentation than a beginner.</p>
<p>Telling someone, especially a beginner, &quot;docs PR's welcome&quot; is both
belitting to the skill that is technical writing, but also generally
considered in opensource to mean &quot;I don't give a shit about your
problem, fuck off&quot;.</p>
