<p>I was noticing that audio to my bluetooth headphones from my iPhone was
always flawless, but I started to noticed stutter and drops from my MBP.
After exhausting some basic ideas, I was stumped.</p>
<p>To the duck duck go machine, and I searched for issues with bluetooth
known issues. Nothing appeared.</p>
<p>However, I then decided to debug the issue - thankfully there was plenty
of advice on this matter. Press shift + option while clicking bluetooth
in the menu-bar, and then you have a debug menu. You can also open
Console.app and search for &quot;bluetooth&quot; to see all the bluetooth
related logs.</p>
<p>I noticed that when the audio stutter occured that the following pattern
was observed.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>default 11:25:45.840532 +1000   wirelessproxd   About to scan for type: 9 - rssi: -90 - payload: &lt;00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000&gt; - mask: &lt;00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 0000&gt; - peers: 0

</span><span>error   11:25:46.225899 +1000   bluetoothaudiod Too many outstanding packets. Drop packet of 8 frames (total drops:451 total sent:60685 percentDropped:0.737700) Outstanding:17
</span></code></pre>
<p>There was always a scan, just before the stutter initiated. So what was
scanning?</p>
<p>I searched for the error related to packets, and there were a lot of
false leads. From weird apps to dodgy headphones. In this case I could
eliminate both as the headphones worked with other devices, and I don't
have many apps installed.</p>
<p>So I went back and thought about what macOS services could be the
problem, and I found that airdrop would scan periodically for other
devices to send and recieve files. Disabling Airdrop from the sharing
menu in System Prefrences cleared my audio right up.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2019-12-20: It looks like the Airdrop sharing option in system
preferences has been removed in 10.15, so I don't believe it's
possible to resove this issue now - audio stutter forever!</p>
