        <h1 id="the-case-for-ethics-in-opensource">The Case for Ethics in OpenSource</h1>
<p>For a long time there have been incidents in technology which have
caused negative effects on people - from leaks of private data, to
interfaces that are not accessible, to even issues like UI's doing
things that may try to subvert a persons intent. I'm sure there are
many more: and we could be here all day listing the various issues that
exist in technology, from small to great.</p>
<p>The theme however is that these issues continue to happen: we continue
to make decisions in applications that can have consequences to humans.</p>
<p>Software is pointless without people. People create software, people
deploy software, people interact with software, and even software
indirectly can influence people's lives. At every layer people exist,
and all software will affect them in some ways.</p>
<p>I think that today, we have made a lot of progress in our communities
around the deployment of code's of conduct. These are great, and really
help us to discuss the decisions and actions we take within our
communities - with the people who create the software. I would like this
to go further, where we can have a framework to discuss the effect of
software on people that we write: the people that deploy, interact with
and are influenced by our work.</p>
<h2 id="disclaimers">Disclaimers</h2>
<p>I'm not a specialist in ethics or morality: I'm not a registered or
certified engineer in the legal sense. Finally, like all humans I am a
product of my experiences which causes all my view points to be biased
through the lens of my experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, I specialise in Identity Management software, so many of
the ideas and issues I have encountered are really specific to this
domain - which means I may overlook the issues in other areas. I also
have a &quot;security&quot; mindset which also factors into my decisions too.</p>
<p>Regardless I hope that this is a starting point to recieve further input
and advice from others, and a place where we can begin to improve.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>TODO: Discuss data handling practices</p>
<p>Let's consider some issues and possible solutions in work that I'm
familiar with - identity management software. Lets list a few
&quot;features&quot;. (Please don't email me about how these are wrong, I know
they are ...)</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing usernames as first and last name</li>
<li>Storing passwords in cleartext.</li>
<li>Deleting an account sets a flag to mark deletion</li>
<li>Names are used as the primary key</li>
<li>We request sex on signup</li>
<li>To change account details, you have to use a command line tool</li>
</ul>
<p>Now &quot;technically&quot;, none of these decisions are incorrect at all. There
is literally no bad technical decision here, and everything is
&quot;technically correct&quot; (not always the best kind of correct).</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-want-to-achieve">What do we want to achieve?</h2>
<p>There are lots of different issues here, but really want to prevent harm
to a person. What is harm? Well that's a complex topic. To me, it could
be emotional harm, disrespect of their person, it could be a feeling of
a lack of control.</p>
<p>I don't believe it's correct to dictate a set of rules that people
should follow. People will be fatigued, and will find the process too
hard. We need to trust that people can learn and want to improve.
Instead I believe it's important we provide important points that
people should be able to consider in a discussion around the development
of software. The same way we discuss technical implementation details,
we should discuss potential human impact in every change we have. To
realise this, we need a short list of important factors that relate to
humans.</p>
<p>I think the following points are important to consider when designing
software. These relate to general principles which I have learnt and
researched.</p>
<p>People should be respected to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Informed consent</li>
<li>Choice over how they are identified</li>
<li>Ability to be forgotten</li>
<li>Individual Autonomy</li>
<li>Free from Harmful Discrimination</li>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Ability to meaningfully access and use software</li>
</ul>
<p>There is already some evidence in research papers to show that there are
strong reasons for moral positions in software. For example, to prevent
harm to come to people, to respect peoples autonomy and to conform to
privacy legislation (
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/it-privacy/#MorReaForProPerDat">source</a>
).</p>
<h2 id="let-s-apply-these">Let's apply these</h2>
<p>Given our set of &quot;features&quot;, lets now discuss these with the above
points in mind.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing usernames as first and last name</li>
</ul>
<p>This point clearly is in violation of the ability to choose how people
are identified - some people may only have a single name, some may have
multiple family names. On a different level this also violates the
harmful discrimination rule due to the potential to disrespect
individuals with cultures that have different name schemes compared to
western/English societies.</p>
<p>A better way to approach this is &quot;displayName&quot; as a freetext UTF8 case
sensitive field, and to allow substring search over the content (rather
than attempting to sort by first/last name which also has a stack of
issues).</p>
<ul>
<li>Storing passwords in cleartext.</li>
</ul>
<p>This one is a violation of privacy, that we risk the exposure of a
password which <em>may</em> have been reused (we can't really stop password
reuse, we need to respect human behaviour). Not only that some people
may assume we DO hash these correctly, so we actually are violating
informed consent as we didn't disclose the method of how we store these
details.</p>
<p>A better thing here is to hash the password, or at least to disclose how
it will be stored and used.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting an account sets a flag to mark deletion</li>
</ul>
<p>This violates the ability to be forgotten, because we aren't really
deleting the account. It also breaks informed consent, because we are
being &quot;deceptive&quot; about what our software is actually doing compared
to the intent of the users request</p>
<p>A better thing is to just delete the account, or if not possible, delete
all user data and leave a tombstone inplace that represents &quot;an account
was here, but no details associated&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Names are used as the primary key</li>
</ul>
<p>This violates choice over identification, especially for women who have
a divorce, or individuals who are transitioning or just people who want
to change their name in general. The reason for the name change doesn't
matter - what matters is we need to respect peoples right to
identification.</p>
<p>A better idea is to use UUID/ID numbers as a primary key, and have name
able to be changed at any point in time.</p>
<ul>
<li>We request sex on signup</li>
</ul>
<p>Violates a privacy as a first point - we probably have no need for the
data unless we are a medical application, so we should never ask for
this at all. We also need to disclose why we need this data to satisfy
informed consent, and potentially to allow them to opt-out of providing
the data. Finally (if we really require this), to not violate self
identification, we need to allow this to be a free-text field rather
than a Male/Female boolean. This is not just in respect of individuals
who are LGBTQI+, but the reality that there are biologically people who
medically are neither. We also need to allow this to be changed at any
time in the future. This in mind Sex and Gender are different concepts,
so we should be careful which we request - Sex is the medical term of a
person's genetics, and Gender is who the person identifies as.</p>
<p>Not only this, because this is a very personal piece of information, we
must disclose how we protect this information from access, who can see
it, and if or how we'll ever share it with other systems or
authorities.</p>
<p>Generally, we probably don't need to know, so don't ask for it at all.</p>
<ul>
<li>To change account details, you have to use a command line tool</li>
</ul>
<p>This violates a users ability to meaningfully access and use software -
remember, people come from many walks of life and all have different
skill sets, but using command line tools is not something we can
universally expect.</p>
<p>A proper solution here is at minimum a web/graphical self management
portal that is easy to access and follows proper UX/UI design rules, and
for a business deploying, a service desk with humans involved that can
support and help people change details on their account on their behalf
if the person is unable to self-support via the web service.</p>
<h2 id="proposal">Proposal</h2>
<p>I think that OpenSource should aim to have a code of ethics - the same
way we have a code of conduct to guide our behaviour internally to a
project, we should have a framework to promote discussion of people's
rights that use, interact with and are affected by our work. We should
not focus on technical matters only, but should be promoting people at
the core of all our work. Every decision we make is not just technical,
but social.</p>
<p>I'm sure that there are more points that could be considere than what I
have listed here: I'd love to hear feedback to william at
blackhats.net.au. Thanks!</p>
