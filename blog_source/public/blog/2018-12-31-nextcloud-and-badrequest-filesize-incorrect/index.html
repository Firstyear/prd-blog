        <h1 id="nextcloud-and-badrequest-filesize-incorrect">Nextcloud and badrequest filesize incorrect</h1>
<p>My friend came to my house and was trying to share some large files with
my nextcloud instance. Part way through the upload an error occurred.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&quot;Exception&quot;:&quot;Sabre\\DAV\\Exception\\BadRequest&quot;,&quot;Message&quot;:&quot;expected filesize 1768906752 got 1768554496&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<p>It turns out this error can be caused by many sources. It could be
timeouts, bad requests, network packet loss, incorrect nextcloud
configuration or more.</p>
<p>We tried uploading larger files (by a factor of 10 times) and they
worked. This eliminated timeouts as a cause, and probably network loss.
Being on ethernet direct to the server generally also helps to eliminate
packet loss as a cause compared to say internet.</p>
<p>We also knew that the server must not have been misconfigured because a
larger file did upload, so no file or resource limits were being hit.</p>
<p>This also indicated that the client was likely doing the right thing
because larger and smaller files would upload correctly. The symptom now
only affected a single file.</p>
<p>At this point I realised, what if the client and server were both
victims to a lower level issue? I asked my friend to ls the file and
read me the number of bytes long. It was 1768906752, as expected in
nextcloud.</p>
<p>Then I asked him to cat that file into a new file, and to tell me the
length of the new file. Cat encountered an error, but ls on the new file
indeed showed a size of 1768554496. That means filesystem corruption!
What could have lead to this?</p>
<p>HFS+</p>
<p>Apple's legacy filesystem (and the reason I stopped using macs) is well
known for silently eating files and corrupting content. Here we had yet
another case of that damage occuring, and triggering errors elsewhere.</p>
<p>Bisecting these issues and eliminating possibilities through a
scientific method is always the best way to resolve the cause, and it
may come from surprising places!</p>
