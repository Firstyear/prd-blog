        <h1 id="rust-2020-helping-to-get-rust-deployed">Rust 2020 - helping to get rust deployed</h1>
<p>This is my contribution to Rust 2020, where community members put
forward ideas on what they thing Rust should aim to achieve in 2020.</p>
<p>In my view, Rust has had an amazing adoption by developers, and is great
if you are in a position to deploy it in your own infrastructure, but we
have yet to really see Rust make it to broad low-level components (IE in
a linux distro or other infrastructure).</p>
<p>As someone who works on &quot;enterprise&quot; software (389-ds) and my own IDM
project (kanidm), there is a need to have software packaged and
distributed. We can not ask our consumers to build and compile these
tools. One could view it as a chain, where I develop software in a
language, it's packaged for a company (like SUSE), and then consumed by
a customer (could be anyone!) who provides a service to others (indirect
users).</p>
<p>Rust however has always been modeled that there is no &quot;middle&quot;
section. You have either a developer who's intent is to develop for
other developers. This is where Rust ideas like crates.io becomes
involved. Alternately, you have a larger example in firefox, where
developers build a project and can &quot;bundle&quot; everything into a whole
unit that is then distributed directly to customers.</p>
<p>The major difference is that in the intermediate distribution case, we
have to take on different responsibilities such as security auditing,
building, ensuring dependencies exist etc.</p>
<p>So this leads me to:</p>
<h2 id="1-cargo-vendor-needs-some-love">1: Cargo Vendor Needs Some Love</h2>
<p>Cargo vendor today is quite confusing in some scenarios, and it's not
clear how to have it work for projects that require offline builds. I
have raised issues about this, but largely they have been un-acted upon.</p>
<h2 id="2-cargo-is-difficult-to-use-in-mixed-language-projects">2: Cargo is Difficult to Use in Mixed Language Projects</h2>
<p>A large value proposition of Rust is the ability to use it with FFI and
C. This is great if you say have cargo compile your C code for you.</p>
<p>But most major existing projects don't. They use autotools, cmake, or
maybe even meson or more esoteric, waf (looking at you samba). Cargo's
extreme opinionation in this area makes it extremely difficult to
integrate Rust into an existing build system reliably. It's hard to
point to one fault, as much as a broader &quot;lack of concern&quot; in the
space, and I think cargo needs to evolve improvements to help allow Rust
to be used from other build tools.</p>
<h2 id="3-rust-moves-too-fast">3: Rust Moves Too Fast</h2>
<p>A lot of &quot;slower&quot; enterprise companies want to move slowly, including
compiler versions. Admittedly, this conservative behaviour is because of
the historical instability of gcc versions and how it can change or
affect your code between releases. Rust doesn't suffer this, but people
are still wary of fast version changes. This means Rustc + Cargo will
get pinned to some version that may be 6 months old.</p>
<p>However crate authors don't consider this - they will use the latest
and greatest features from stable (and sometimes still nightly ...
grrr) in releases. Multiple times I have found that on my development
environment even with a 3 month old compiler, dependencies won't build.</p>
<p>Compounding this, crates.io doesn't distinguish a security release from
a feature one. Crates also encourages continuall version bumping, rather
than maintenence of versioned branches. IE version 0.4.3 of a crate with
a security fix will become 0.4.4, but then a feature update to include
try_from may go to 0.4.5 as it &quot;adds&quot; to the api, or they use it
internally as a cleanup.</p>
<p>Part of this issue is that Rust applications need to be treated closer
to docker, as static whole units where only the resulting binary is
supported rather than the toolchain that built it. But that only works
on pure Rust applications - any mixed C + Rust application will hit this
issue due to the difference between a system Rust version and what crate
dependencies publish.</p>
<p>So I think that from this it leads to:</p>
<h2 id="3-1-crates-need-to-indicate-a-minimum-supported-compiler-version">3.1: Crates need to indicate a minimum supported compiler version</h2>
<p>Rust has &quot;toyed&quot; with the idea of editions, but within 2018 we've
seen new features like maybeuninit and try_from land, which within an
&quot;edition&quot; caused crates to stop worked on older compilers.</p>
<p>As a result, editions I think is &quot;too broad&quot; and people will fear
incrementing it, and Rust will add features without changing edition
anyway. Instead Rust needs to consider following up on the minimum
supported rust version flag RFC. Rust has made it pretty clear the only
&quot;edition&quot; flag that matters is the rust compiler version based on
crate developers and what they are releasing.</p>
<h2 id="3-2-rust-needs-to-think-what-s-our-end-goal">3.2: Rust Needs to Think &quot;What's Our End Goal&quot;</h2>
<p>Rust is still moving incredibly fast, and I think in a way we need to
ask ... when will Rust be finished? When will it as a language go from
continually rapid growth to stable and known feature sets? The idea of
Rust editions acts as though this has happened (saying we change only
every few years) when this is clearly not the case. Rust is evolving
release-on-release, every 6 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="4-zero-cost-needs-to-factor-in-human-cost">4: Zero Cost Needs to Factor in Human Cost</h2>
<p>My final wish for Rust is that sometimes we are so obsessed with the
technical desire for zero cost abstraction, that we forget the high
human cost and barriers that can exist as a result making feature
adoption challenging. Rust has had a great community that treats people
very well, and I think sometimes we need to extend that into feature
development, to really consider the human cognitive cost of a feature.</p>
<p>Summarised - what's the benefit of a zero cost abstraction if people
can not work out how to use it?</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I want to see Rust become a major part of operating systems and how we
build computer systems, but I think that we need to pace ourselves,
improve our tooling, and have some better ideas around what Rust should
look like.</p>
