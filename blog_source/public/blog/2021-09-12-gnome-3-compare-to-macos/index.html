        <h1 id="gnome-3-compare-to-macos">Gnome 3 compare to MacOs</h1>
<p>An assertion I have made in the past is that to me &quot;Gnome 3 feels like
MacOs with rough edges&quot;. After some discussions with others, I'm
finally going to write this up with examples.</p>
<p>It's worth pointing out that in my opinion, Gnome 3 is probably still
the best desktop experience on Linux today for a variety of reasons -
it's just that for me, these rough edges really take away from that
being a good experience for me.</p>
<h2 id="high-level-structure-comparison">High Level Structure Comparison</h2>
<p>Here's a pair of screenshots of MacOS 11.5.2 and Gnome 40.4. In both we
have the settings menu open of the respective environment. Both are set
to the resolution of 1680x1050, with the Mac using scaling from retina
(2880x1800) to this size.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/gnome-settings-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-settings-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>From this view, we can already make some observations. Both of these
have a really similar structure which when we look at appears like this:</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/skeleton.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>The skeleton overall looks really similar, if not identical. We have a
top bar that provides a system tray and status and a system context in
the top left, as well as application context.</p>
<p>Now we can look at some of the details of each of the platforms at a
high level from this skeleton.</p>
<p>We can see on the Mac that the &quot;top menu bar&quot; takes 2.6% of our
vertical screen real-estate. Our system context is provided by the small
Apple logo in the top left that opens to a menu of various platform
options.</p>
<p>Next to that, we can see that our system preferences uses that top menu
bar to provide our application context menus like edit, view, window and
help. Further, on the right side of this we have a series of icons for
our system - some of these from third party applications like nextcloud,
and others coming from macos showing our backup status, keyboard, audio,
battery, wifi time and more. This is using the space at the top of our
screen really effectively, it doesn't feel wasted, and adds context to
what we are doing.</p>
<p>If we now look at Gnome we can see a different view. Our menu bar takes
3.5% of our vertical screen realestate, and the dark colour already
feels like it is &quot;dominating&quot; visually. In that we have very little
effective horizontal space use. The activities button (system context)
takes us to our overview screen, and selecting the &quot;settings&quot; item
which is our current application has no response or menu displayed.</p>
<p>The system tray doesn't allow 3rd party applications, and the overview
only shows our network and audio status and our clock (battery may be
displayed on a laptop). To find more context about our system requires
interaction with the single component at the top right, limiting our
ability to interact with a specific element (network, audio etc) or
understand our systems state quickly.</p>
<p>Already we can start to see some differences here.</p>
<ul>
<li>UI elements in MacOS are smaller and consume less screen space.</li>
<li>Large amounts of non-functional dead space in Gnome</li>
<li>Elements are visually more apparently and able to be seen at a high
level, where Gnome's require interaction to find details</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system-preferences-vs-settings">System Preferences vs Settings</h2>
<p>Let's compare the system preferences and Settings now. These are still
similar, but not as close as our overall skeleton and this is where we
start to see more about the different approaches to design in each.</p>
<p>The MacOS system preferences has all of it's top level options
displayed in a grid, with an easily accesible search function and
forward and back navigation aides. This make it easy to find the
relevant area that is required, and everything is immediately accessible
and clear. Searching for items dims the application and begins to
highlight elements that contain the relevant topic, helping to guide you
to the location and establishing to the user where they can go in the
future without the need to search. Inside any menu of the system
preferences, search is always accesible and in the same consistent
location of the application.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-settings-search.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>When we look at Gnome, in the settings application we see that not all
available settings are displayed - the gutter column on the left is a
scrollable UI element, but with no scroll bars present, this could be
missed by a user that the functionality is present. Items like
&quot;Applications&quot; which have a &quot;&gt;&quot; present confusingly changes the
gutter context to a list of applications rather than remaining at the
top level when selected like all other items that don't have the
&quot;&gt;&quot;. Breaking the users idea of consistency, when in these
sub-gutters, the search icon is replaced with the &quot;back&quot; navigation
icon, meaning you can not search when in a sub-gutter.</p>
<p>Finally, even visually we can see that the settings is physically larger
as a window, with much larger fonts and the title bar containing much
more dead space. The search icon (when present) requires interaction
before the search text area appears adding extra clicks and interactions
to achieve the task.</p>
<p>When we do search, the results are replaced into the gutter element.
Screen lock here is actually in a sub-gutter menu for privacy, and not
discoverable at the top level as an element. The use of nested gutters
here adds confusion about where items are due to all the gutter content
changes.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/gnome-settings-search.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Again we are starting to see differences here:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacOS search uses greater visual feedback to help guide users to
where they need to be</li>
<li>Gnome hides many options in sub-menus, or with very few graphical
guides which hinders discovery of items</li>
<li>Again, the use of dead space in Gnome vs the greater use of space in
MacOS</li>
<li>Gnome requires more interactions to &quot;get around&quot; in general</li>
<li>Gnome applications visually are larger and take up more space of the
screen</li>
<li>Gnome changes the UI and layout in subtle and inconsistent ways that
rely on contextual knowledge of &quot;where&quot; you currently are in the
application</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="context-menus">Context Menus</h2>
<p>Lets have a look at some of the menus that exist in the system tray area
now. For now I'll focus on audio, but these differences broadly apply
to all of the various items here on MacOS and Gnome.</p>
<p>On MacOS when we select our audio icon in the system tray, we are
presented with a menu that contains the current volume, the current
audio output device (including options for network streaming) and a link
to the system preferencs control panel for further audio settings that
may exist. We aren't overwhelmed with settings or choices, but we do
have the ability to change our common options and shortcut links to get
to the extended settings if needed.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-audio-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>A common trick in MacOS though is holding the option key during
interactions. Often this can display power-user or extended
capabilities. When done on the audio menu, we are also able to then
control our input device selection.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-audio-2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>On Gnome, in the system tray there is only a single element, that
controls audio, power, network and more.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/gnome-audio-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>All we can do in this menu is control the volume - that's it. There are
no links to direct audio settings, device management, and there are no
&quot;hidden&quot; shortcuts (like option) that allows greater context or
control.</p>
<p>To summarise our differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacOS provides topic-specific system tray menus, with greater
functionality and links to further settings</li>
<li>Gnome has a combined menu, that is limited in functionality, and has
only a generic link to settings</li>
<li>Gnome lacks the ability to gain extended options for power-users to
view extra settings or details</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="file-browser">File Browser</h2>
<p>Finally lets look at the file browser. For fairness, I've changed
Gnome's default layout to &quot;list&quot; to match my own usage in finder.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-files-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>We can already see a number of useful elements here. We have the ability
to &quot;tree&quot; folders through the &quot;&gt;&quot; icon, and rows of the browser
alternate white/grey to help us visually identify lines horizontally.
The rows are small and able to have (in this screenshot) 16 rows of
content on the screen simultaneously. Finally, not shown here, but MacOS
finder can use tabs for browsing different locations. And as before, we
have our application context menu in the top bar with a large amount of
actions available.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/gnome-files-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Gnomes rows are all white with extremely faint grey lines to delineate,
making it hard to horizontally track items if the window was expanded.
The icons are larger, and there is no ability to tree the files and
folders. We can only see ~10 rows on screen despite the similar size of
the windows presented here. Finally, the extended options are hidden in
the &quot;burger&quot; menu next to the application close.</p>
<p>A theme should be apparent here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both MacOS and Gnome share a very similar skeleton of how this
application is laid out</li>
<li>MacOS makes better use of visual elements to help your eye track
across spaces to make connections</li>
<li>Gnome has a lot of dead space still and larger text and icons which
takes greater amounts of screen space</li>
<li>Due to the application context and other higher level items, MacOS
is &quot;faster&quot; to get to where you need to go</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts are something that aide powerusers to achieve tasks
quicker, but the challenge is often <em>finding</em> what shortcuts exist to
use them. Lets look at how MacOS and Gnome solve this.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-shortcut-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>Here in MacOS, anytime we open a menu, we can see the shortcut listed
next to the menu item that is present, including disabled items (that
are dimmed). Each shortcut's symbols match the symbols of the keyboard
allowing these to be cross-language and accessible. And since we are in
a menu, we remain in the context of our Application and able to then
immediately use the menu or shortcut.</p>
<p>In fact, even if we select the help menu and search a new topic, rather
than take us away from menu's, MacOS opens the menu and points us to
where we are trying to go, allowing us to find the action we want <em>and</em>
learn it's shortcut!</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/macos-shortcut-2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>This is great, because it means in the process of getting help, we are
shown how to perform the action for future interactions. Because of the
nature of MacOS human interface guidelines this pattern exists for <em>all</em>
applications on the platform, including third party ones helping to
improve accessibility of these features.</p>
<p>Gnome however takes a really different approach. Keyboard shortcuts are
listed as a menu item from our burger menu.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/gnome-shortcut-1.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>When we select it, our applications context is taken away and replaced
with a dictionary of keyboard shortcuts, spread over three pages.</p>
<p><img src="/_static/gnome_v_macos/gnome-shortcut-2.png" alt="image" /></p>
<p>I think the use of the keyboard icons here is excellent, but because we
are now in a dictionary of shortcuts, it's hard to find what we want to
use, and we &quot;taken away&quot; from the context of the actions we are trying
to perform in our application. Again, we have to perform more
interactions to find the information that we are looking for in our
applications, and we aren't able to easily link the action to the
shortcut in this style of presentation. We can't transfer our knowledge
of the &quot;menus&quot; into a shortcut that we can use without going through a
reference manual.</p>
<p>Another issue here is this becomes the responsibility of each
application to create these references and provide them, rather than
being an automatically inherited feature through the adherence to human
interface guidelines.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Honestly, I could probably keep making these comparisons all day. Gnome
3 and MacOS really do feel very similar to me. From style of keyboard
shortcuts, layout of the UI, the structure of it's applications and
even it's approach to windowing feels identical to MacOS. However while
it looks similar on a surface level, there are many rough edges, excess
interactions, poor use of screen space and visual elements.</p>
<p>MacOS certainly has it's flaws, and makes it's mistakes. But from a
ease of use perspective, it tries to get out of the way and show you how
to use the computer for yourself. MacOS takes a back seat to the usage
of the computer.</p>
<p>Gnome however feels like it wants to be front and centre. It needs you
to know all the time &quot;you're using Gnome!&quot;. It takes you on a small
adventure tour to complete simple actions or to discover new things. It
even feels like Gnome has tried to reduce &quot;complexity&quot; so much that
they have thrown away many rich features and interactions that could
make a computer easier to use and interact with.</p>
<p>So for me, this is why I feel that Gnome is like MacOS with rough edges.
There are many small, subtle and frustrating user interactions like this
all through out the Gnome 3 experience that just aren't present in
MacOS.</p>
