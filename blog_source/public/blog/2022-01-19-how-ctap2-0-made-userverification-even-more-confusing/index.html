        <h1 id="how-ctap2-0-made-userverification-even-more-confusing">How CTAP2.0 made UserVerification even more confusing</h1>
<p>I have previously written about how <a href="../../../2020/11/21/webauthn_userverificationpolicy_curiosities.html">Webauthn introduces a false sense
of
security</a>
with how it manages UserVerification (UV) by default. To summarise, when
you request &quot;preferred&quot; which means &quot;perform UV if possible&quot;, it can
be bypassed since relying parties's (RP) do <em>not</em> check if UV was
actually performed, and Webauthn makes no recommendations on how to
store credentials in a manner that allows future checking to ensure UV
is requested or validated correctly.</p>
<p>From this, in Webauthn-RS we made the recommendation that you use either
&quot;required&quot; to enforce all credentials have performed UV, or
&quot;discouraged&quot; to request that <em>no</em> UV is performed by credentials
during authentication or registration.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the Webauthn-RS project we begun to store two
important pieces of credential metadata beyond the Webauthn
specification - the result of UV from registration, and the policy that
was requested at the time of registration. We did this because we had
noticed there were classes of credentials, that even in &quot;discouraged&quot;
would always verify themself at registration and authentication. Because
of this property, we would enforce that since UV was performed at
registration, we could continue to enforce UV on a per credential basis
to detect possible credential compromise, and to further strengthen the
security of credentials used with Webauthn-RS.</p>
<p>This created 3 workflows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required - At registration and authentication UV is always required</li>
<li>Discouraged + no UV - At registration and authentication UV is never
required</li>
<li>Discouraged + always UV - At registration and authentication UV is
always required</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-bug-report">A bug report ...</h2>
<p>We recieved a bug that an authenticator was failing to work with
Webauthn-RS, because at registration it would always force UV, but
during authentication it would <em>never</em> request UV. This was triggering
our inconsistent credential detection, indicating the credential was
possibly compromised.</p>
<p>In this situation, the authenticator used an open-source firmware, so I
was able to look at the source and identify the programming issue.
During registration UV is <em>always</em> required, but during &quot;discouraged&quot;
in authentication it's <em>never</em> required matching the reported bug.</p>
<p>The author of the library then directed me to the fact that in
<a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html#authenticatorMakeCredential">CTAP2.0</a>
this behaviour is <em>enshrined in the specification</em>.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-this-behaviour-bad">Why is this behaviour bad?</h2>
<p>I performed a quick poll on twitter, and asked about 5 non-technical
friends about this. The question I asked was:</p>
<p><em>You go to a website, and you're asked to setup a yubikey. When you
register the key you're asked for a pin. Do you now expect the pin to be
required when you authenticate to that website with that yubikey now?</em></p>
<p>From the 31 votes on twitter, the result was 60% (21 / 30) that &quot;yes&quot;
this PIN will always be required. From the people I asked directly, they
all responded &quot;yes&quot;. (This is in no way an official survey or
significant numbers, but it's an initial indication)</p>
<p>Humans expect things to behave in a <em>consistent</em> manner. When you take
an action one time, something will always continue to behave in that
way. The issue we are presented with in this situation is that CTAP2.0
fundamentally breaks this association by changing the behaviour between
registration and authentication. It also is not communicated that the
different is registration vs authentication, or even <em>why</em> this
behaviour is changed.</p>
<p>As a result, this confuses users (&quot;Why is my pin not always
required?!&quot;) and this can at worst cause users to be apathetic about
the UV check, where it could be downgraded from &quot;required/preferred&quot;
to &quot;discouraged&quot; and the user would not notice or care about &quot;why is
this different?&quot;. Because RP's that strictly follow the Webauthn
specification are open to UV bypass, CTAP2.0 in this case has helped to
open the door for users to be tricked into this.</p>
<p>The other issue is that for a library like Webauthn-RS we lose the
ability to detect credential compromise or attempts to bypass UV when in
discouraged, since now UV is not consistently enforced across all
classes of authenticators.</p>
<h2 id="can-it-be-fixed">Can it be fixed?</h2>
<p>No. There are changes in CTAP2.1 that can set the token to be &quot;always
verified&quot; and for extensions to be sent that always enforce UV of that
credential, but none of these assist the CTAP2.0 case where none of
these elements exist.</p>
<p>As an RP library author we have to assume and work out ways to interact
with credentials that are CTAP2.0_pre, CTAP2.0, CTAP2.1, vendor
developed and more. We have to find a way to use the elements at hand to
create a consistent user interface, that also embed security elements
that can not be bypassed or downgraded.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time thinking about how to resolve this, but I can only
conclude that CTAP2.0 has made &quot;discouraged&quot; less meaningful by adding
in this confusing behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-the-end-of-the-world">Is this the end of the world?</h2>
<p>Not at all. But it does undermine users trust in the systems we are
building, where people may end up believing that UV is pointless and
never checked. There are a lot of smart bad-people out there and they
may utilise this in attacks (especially when combined with the fact that
RP's who strictly follow the Webauthn standard are already open to UV
bypass in many cases).</p>
<p>If the goal we have is to move to a passwordless world, we need people
to trust their devices behave in a manner that is predictable and that
they understand. By making UV sometimes there, sometimes not, it will be
a much higher barrier to convince people they can trust these devices as
a self contained multifactor authenticator.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-an-authentication-provider-what-can-i-do">I use an authentication provider, what can I do?</h2>
<p>If possible, setup your authentication provider to have UV required.
This will cause some credentials to no longer work in your environment,
but it will ensure that every authenticator has a consistent experience.
In most cases, your authentication provider is likely to be standards
compliant, and will not perform the extended verification discussed
below meaning that &quot;preferred&quot; is bypassable, and &quot;discouraged&quot; can
have inconsistent UV requests from users.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-an-rp-do">What can an RP do?</h2>
<p>Because of this change, there are really only three workflows now that
are actually consistent for users where we can enforce UV properties are
observed correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Required - At registration and authentication UV is always required</li>
<li>Preferred + with UV - At registration and authentication UV is
always required</li>
<li>Preferred + no UV - At registration and authentication UV should not
be required</li>
</ul>
<p>The way that this is achieved is an extension to the Webauthn
specification. When you register a credential you <em>must</em> store the state
of the UV boolean at registration, and you <em>must</em> store the policy that
was requested at registration. During authentication the following is
checked in place of the webauthn defined UV check:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>if credential.registration_policy == required OR authentication.policy == required {
</span><span>    assert(authentication.uv == true)
</span><span>} else if credential.registration_policy == preferred AND credential.registration_uv == true {
</span><span>    // We either sent authentication.policy preferred or discouraged, but the user registered
</span><span>    // with UV so we enforce that behaviour.
</span><span>    assert(authentication.uv == true)
</span><span>} else {
</span><span>    // Do not check uv.
</span><span>}
</span></code></pre>
<p>There is a single edge case in this work flow - since we now send
&quot;preferred&quot; it's possible that a credential that registered without
UV (IE via Firefox which doesn't support CTAP2.0_pre or greater) will
be moved to using a platform that does support CTAP2.0_pre or greater,
and it will begin to request UV. It is however possible in this scenario
that once the credential begins to provide UV we can then store the
credential.uv as true and enforce that for future authentications.</p>
<p>The primary issue with this is that we will begin to ask for the user's
PIN more often with credentials which may lead to frustration.
Biometrics this is less of a concern as the &quot;touch&quot; action is always
required anyway. However I think this is acceptable since it's more
important for a consistent set of behaviours to exist.</p>
<p>Previously I have stated that &quot;preferred&quot; should not be used since it
is bypassable, but with the extensions to Webauthn above where policy
and uv at registration are stored and validated, preferred gains a
proper meaning and can be checked and enforced.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In the scenarioes where &quot;discouraged&quot; and &quot;preferred&quot; may be used,
UV is meaningless in the current definition of the Webauthn
specification when paired with the various versions of CTAP. It's
merely a confusing annoyance that we present to users seemingly at
random, that is trivially bypassed, adds little to no security value and
at worst undermines user trust in the systems we are trying to build.</p>
<p>When we are building authentication systems, we must always think about
and consider the humans who will be using these systems, and the
security properties that we actually provide in these systems.</p>
