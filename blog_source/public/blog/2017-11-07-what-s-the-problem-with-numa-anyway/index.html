        <h1 id="what-s-the-problem-with-numa-anyway">What's the problem with NUMA anyway?</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-numa">What is NUMA?</h2>
<p>Non-Uniform Memory Architecture is a method of seperating ram and memory
management units to be associated with CPU sockets. The reason for this
is performance - if multiple sockets shared a MMU, they will cause each
other to block, delaying your CPU.</p>
<p>To improve this, each NUMA region has it's own MMU and RAM associated.
If a CPU can access it's local MMU and RAM, this is very fast, and does
<em>not</em> prevent another CPU from accessing it's own. For example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>CPU 0   &lt;-- QPI --&gt; CPU 1
</span><span>  |                   |
</span><span>  v                   v
</span><span>MMU 0               MMU 1
</span><span>  |                   |
</span><span>  v                   v
</span><span>RAM 1               RAM 2
</span></code></pre>
<p>For example, on the following system, we can see 1 numa region:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span># numactl --hardware
</span><span>available: 1 nodes (0)
</span><span>node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3
</span><span>node 0 size: 12188 MB
</span><span>node 0 free: 458 MB
</span><span>node distances:
</span><span>node   0 
</span><span>  0:  10 
</span></code></pre>
<p>On this system, we can see two:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span># numactl --hardware
</span><span>available: 2 nodes (0-1)
</span><span>node 0 cpus: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35
</span><span>node 0 size: 32733 MB
</span><span>node 0 free: 245 MB
</span><span>node 1 cpus: 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47
</span><span>node 1 size: 32767 MB
</span><span>node 1 free: 22793 MB
</span><span>node distances:
</span><span>node   0   1
</span><span>  0:  10  20
</span><span>  1:  20  10
</span></code></pre>
<p>This means that on the second system there is 32GB of ram per NUMA
region which is accessible, but the system has total 64GB.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The problem arises when a process running on NUMA region 0 has to access
memory from another NUMA region. Because there is no direct connection
between CPU 0 and RAM 1, we must communicate with our neighbour CPU 1 to
do this for us. IE:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>CPU 0 --&gt; CPU 1 --&gt; MMU 1 --&gt; RAM 1
</span></code></pre>
<p>Not only do we pay a time delay price for the QPI communication between
CPU 0 and CPU 1, but now CPU 1's processes are waiting on the MMU 1
because we are retrieving memory on behalf of CPU 0. This is very slow
(and can be seen by the node distances in the numactl --hardware
output).</p>
<h2 id="today-s-work-around">Today's work around</h2>
<p>The work around today is to limit your Directory Server instance to a
single NUMA region. So for our example above, we would limit the
instance to NUMA region 0 or 1, and treat the instance as though it only
has access to 32GB of local memory.</p>
<p>It's possible to run two instances of DS on a single server, pinning
them to their own regions and using replication between them to provide
synchronisation. You'll need a load balancer to fix up the TCP port
changes, or you need multiple addresses on the system for listening.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>In the future, we'll be adding support for better copy-on-write
techniques that allow the cores to better cache content after a QPI
negotiation - but we still have to pay the transit cost. We can minimise
this as much as possible, but there is no way today to avoid this
penalty. To use all your hardware on a single instance, there will
always be a NUMA cost somewhere.</p>
<p>The best solution is as above: run an instance per NUMA region, and
internally provide replication for them. Perhaps we'll support an
automatic configuration of this in the future.</p>
