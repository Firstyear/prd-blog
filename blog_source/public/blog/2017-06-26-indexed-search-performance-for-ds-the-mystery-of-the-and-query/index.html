        <h1 id="indexed-search-performance-for-ds-the-mystery-of-the-and-query">indexed search performance for ds - the mystery of the and query</h1>
<p>Directory Server is heavily based on set mathematics - one of the few
topics I enjoyed during university. Our filters really boil down to set
queries:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&amp;((attr=val1)(attr=val2))
</span></code></pre>
<p>This filter describes the intersection of sets of objects containing
&quot;attr=val1&quot; and &quot;attr=val2&quot;.</p>
<p>One of the properties of sets is that operations on them are
commutative - the sets to a union or intersection may be supplied in any
order with the same results. As a result, these are equivalent:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&amp;(a)(b)(c)
</span><span>&amp;(b)(a)(c)
</span><span>&amp;(c)(b)(a)
</span><span>&amp;(c)(a)(b)
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>In the past I noticed an odd behaviour: that the <em>order</em> of filter terms
in an ldapsearch query would drastically change the performance of the
search. For example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>&amp;(a)(b)(c)
</span><span>&amp;(c)(b)(a)
</span></code></pre>
<p>The later query may significantly outperform the former - but 10% or
greater. I have never understood the reason why though. I toyed with
ideas of re-arranging queries in the optimise step to put the terms in a
better order, but I didn't know what factors affected this behaviour.</p>
<p>Over time I realised that if you put the &quot;more specific&quot; filters first
over the general filters, you would see a performance increase.</p>
<h2 id="what-was-going-on">What was going on?</h2>
<p>Recently I was asked to investigate a full table scan issue with range
queries. This led me into an exploration of our search internals, and
yielded the answer to the issue above.</p>
<p>Inside of directory server, our indexes are maintained as &quot;pre-baked&quot;
searches. Rather than trying to search every object to see if a filter
matches, our indexes contain a list of entries that match a term. For
example:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>uid=mark: 1, 2
</span><span>uid=william: 3
</span><span>uid=noriko: 4
</span></code></pre>
<p>From each indexed term we construct an IDList, which is the set of
entries matching some term.</p>
<p>On a complex query we would need to intersect these. So the algorithm
would iteratively apply this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>t1 = (a, b)
</span><span>t2 = (c, t1)
</span><span>t3 = (d, t2)
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>In addition, the intersection would allocate a new IDList to insert the
results into.</p>
<p>What would happen is that if your first terms were large, we would
allocate large IDLists, and do many copies into it. This would also
affect later filters as we would need to check large ID spaces to
perform the final intersection.</p>
<p>In the above example, consider a, b, c all have 10,000 candidates. This
would mean t1, t2 is at least 10,000 IDs, and we need to do at least
20,000 comparisons. If d were only 3 candidates, this means that we then
throw away the majority of work and allocations when we get to t3 = (d,
t2).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-fix">What is the fix?</h2>
<p>We now wrap each term in an idl_set processing api. When we get the
IDList from each AVA, we insert it to the idl_set. This tracks the
&quot;minimum&quot; IDList, and begins our intersection from the smallest
matching IDList. This means that we have the quickest reduction in set
size, and results in the smallest possible IDList allocation for the
results. In my tests I have seen up to 10% improvement on complex
queries.</p>
<p>For the example above, this means we procees d first, to reduce t1 to
the smallest possible candidate set we can.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>t1 = (d, a)
</span><span>t2 = (b, t1)
</span><span>t3 = (c, t2)
</span><span>...
</span></code></pre>
<p>This means to create t2, t3, we will do an allocation that is bounded by
the size of d (aka 3, rather than 10,000), we only need to perform fewer
queries to reach this point.</p>
<p>A benefit of this strategy is that it means if on the first operation we
find t1 is empty set, we can return <em>immediately</em> because no other
intersection will have an impact on the operation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-next">What is next?</h2>
<p>I still have not improved union performance - this is still somewhat
affected by the ordering of terms in a filter. However, I have a number
of ideas related to either bitmask indexes or disjoin set structures
that can be used to improve this performance.</p>
<p>Stay tuned ....</p>
