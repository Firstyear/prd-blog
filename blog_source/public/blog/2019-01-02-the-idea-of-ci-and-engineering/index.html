        <h1 id="the-idea-of-ci-and-engineering">The idea of CI and Engineering</h1>
<p>In software development I see and interesting trend and push towards
continuous integration, continually testing, and testing in production.
These techniques are designed to allow faster feedback on errors, use
real data for application testing, and to deliver features and changes
faster.</p>
<p>But is that really how people use software on devices? When we consider
an operation like google or amazon, this always online technique may
work, but what happens when we apply a continous integration and
&quot;we'll patch it later&quot; mindset to devices like phones or internet of
things?</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-in-other-disciplines">What happens in other disciplines?</h2>
<p>In real engineering disciplines like aviation or construction,
techniques like this don't really work. We don't continually build
bridges, then fix them when they break or collapse. There are people who
provide formal analysis of materials, their characteristics. Engineers
consider careful designs, constraints, loads and situations that may
occur. The structure is planned, reviewed and verified mathematically.
Procedures and oversight is applied to ensure correct building of the
structure. Lessons are learnt from past failures and incidents and are
applied into every layer of the design and construction process.
Communication between engineers and many other people is critical to the
process. Concerns are always addressed and managed.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that if we just built lots of scale-model
bridges and continually broke them until we found their limits, this
would waste many resources to do this. Bridges are carefully planned and
proven.</p>
<h2 id="so-whats-the-point-with-software">So whats the point with software?</h2>
<p>Today we still have a mindset that continually breaking and building is
a reasonable path to follow. It's not! It means that the only way to
achieve quality is to have a large test suite (requires people and time
to write), which has to be further derived from failures (and those
failures can negatively affect real people), then we have to apply large
amounts of electrical energy to continually run the tests. The test
suites can't even guarantee complete coverage of all situations and
occurances!</p>
<p>This puts CI techniques out of reach of many application developers due
to time and energy (translated to dollars) limits. Services like travis
on github certainly helps to lower the energy requirement, but it
doesn't stop the time and test writing requirements.</p>
<p>No matter how many tests we have for a program, if that program is
written in C or something else, we continually see faults and
security/stability issues in that software.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-we-ci-on-a-phone">What if we CI on ... a phone?</h2>
<p>Today we even have hardware devices that are approached as though they
&quot;test in production&quot; is a reasonable thing. It's not! People don't
patch, telcos don't allow updates out to users, and those that are
aware, have to do custom rom deployment. This creates an odd dichomtemy
of &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;haves not&quot;, of those in technical know how who have
a better experience, and the &quot;haves not&quot; who have to suffer
potentially insecure devices. This is especially terrifying given how
deeply personal phones are.</p>
<p>This is a reality of our world. People do not patch. They do not patch
phones, laptops, network devices and more. Even enterprises will avoid
patching if possible. Rather than trying to shift the entire culture of
humans to &quot;update always&quot;, we need to write software that can cope in
harsh conditions, for long term. We only need to look to software in
aviation to see we can absolutely achieve this!</p>
<h2 id="what-should-we-do">What should we do?</h2>
<p>I believe that for software developers to properly become software
engineers we should look to engineers in civil and aviation industries.
We need to apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Regualation and ethics (Safety of people is always first)</li>
<li>Formal verification</li>
<li>Consider all software will run long term (5+ years)</li>
<li>Improve team work and collaboration on designs and development</li>
</ul>
<p>The reality of our world is people are deploying devices (routers,
networks, phones, lights, laptops more ...) where they may never be
updated or patched in their service life. Even I'm guilty (I have a
modem that's been unpatched for about 6 years but it's pretty locked
down ...). As a result we need to rely on proof that the device <em>can
not</em> fail at build time, rather than <em>patch it later</em> which may never
occur! Putting formal verification first, and always considering user
safety and rights first, shifts a large burden to us in terms of time.
But many tools (Coq, fstar, rust ...) all make formal verification more
accessible to use in our industry. Verifying our software is a far
stronger assertion of quality than &quot;throw tests at it and hope it
works&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="you-re-crazy-william-and-also-wrong">You're crazy William, and also wrong</h2>
<p>Am I? Looking at &quot;critical&quot; systems like iPhone encryption hardware,
they are running the formally verified Sel4. We also heard at Kiwicon in
2018 that Microsoft and XBox are using formal verification to design
their low levels of their system to prevent exploits from occuring in
the first place.</p>
<p>Over time our industry will evolve, and it will become easier and more
cost effective to formally verify than to operate and deploy CI. This
doesn't mean we don't need tests - it means that the first line of
quality should be in verification of correctness using formal techniques
rather than using tests and CI to prove correct behaviour. Tests are
certainly still required to assert further behavioural elements of
software.</p>
<p>Today, if you want to do this, you should be looking at Coq and program
extraction, fstar and the kremlin (project everest, a formally verified
https stack), Rust (which has a subset of the safe language formally
proven). I'm sure there are more, but these are the ones I know off the
top of my head.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Over time our industry <em>must</em> evolve to put the safety of humans first.
To achive this we must look to other safety driven cultures such as
aviation and civil engineering. Only by learning from their strict
disciplines and behaviours can we start to provide software that matches
behavioural and quality expectations humans have for software.</p>
