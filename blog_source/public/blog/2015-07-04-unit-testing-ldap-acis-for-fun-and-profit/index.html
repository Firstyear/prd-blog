<p>My workplace is a reasonably sized consumer of 389ds. We use it for
storing pretty much all our most important identity data from allowing
people to authenticate, to group and course membership, to email routing
and even internet access.</p>
<p>As a result, it's a really important service to maintain. We need to
treat it as one of the most security sensitive services we run. The
definition of security I always come back to is &quot;availability,
integrity and confidentiality&quot;. Now, we have a highly available
environment, and we use TLS with our data to ensure confidentiality of
results and queries. Integrity however, is the main target of this post.</p>
<p>LDAP allows objects that exist with in the directory to &quot;bind&quot;
(authenticate) and then to manipulate other objects in the directories.
A set of ACIs (Access Control Instructions) define what objects can
modify other objects and their attributes.</p>
<p>ACIs are probably one of the most complex parts in a directory server
environment to &quot;get right&quot; (With the exception maybe of VLV).</p>
<p>I noticed during a security review of our directories ACIs that took the
following pattern.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>aci: (targetattr !=&quot;cn&quot;)(version 3.0;acl &quot;Self write all but cn&quot;;allow (write)(userdn = &quot;ldap:///self&quot;);)
</span><span>aci: (targetattr !=&quot;sn&quot;)(version 3.0;acl &quot;Self write all but sn&quot;;allow (write)(userdn = &quot;ldap:///self&quot;);)
</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, the rules in question we had were more complex and had more rules,
but at their essence looked like this. Seems like an innocuous set of
rules. &quot;Allow self write to everything but sn&quot; and &quot;Allow self write
to everything but cn&quot;.</p>
<p>So at the end we expect to see we can write everything but sn and cn.</p>
<p>Lets use the ldap effective permissions capability to check this:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>/usr/lib64/mozldap/ldapsearch -D &#39;cn=Directory Manager&#39; -w - -b &#39;cn=test,ou=people,dc=example,dc=net,dc=au&#39; \
</span><span>-J &quot;1.3.6.1.4.1.42.2.27.9.5.2:false:dn: cn=test,ou=people,dc=example,dc=net,dc=au&quot; &quot;(objectClass=*)&quot;
</span><span>
</span><span>version: 1
</span><span>dn: cn=test,ou=People,dc=example,dc=net,dc=au
</span><span>objectClass: top
</span><span>objectClass: person
</span><span>cn: test
</span><span>sn: test
</span><span>userPassword: 
</span><span>entryLevelRights: v
</span><span>attributeLevelRights: objectClass:rscwo, cn:rscwo, sn:rscwo, userPassword:wo
</span></code></pre>
<p>What! Why does cn have r[ead] s[search] c[ompare] w[rite]
o[bliterate]? That was denied? Same for SN.</p>
<p>Well, LDAP treats ACIs as a positive union.</p>
<p>So we have:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>aci 1 = ( objectclass, sn, userpassword)
</span><span>aci 2 = ( objectclass, cn, userpassword)
</span><span>aci 1 U aci 2 = ( objectclass, sn, cn, userpassword )
</span></code></pre>
<p>As a result, our seemingly secure rules, actually were conflicting and
causing our directory to be highly insecure!</p>
<p>So, easy to change this: First we invert the rules (be explicit in all
things) to say targetattr = &quot;userpassword&quot; for example. We shouldn't
use != rules because they can even conflict between groups and self.</p>
<p>How do we detect these issues though?</p>
<p>I wrote a python library called usl (university simple ldap). In this I
have a toolset for unit testing our ldap acis.</p>
<p>We create a py.test testcase, that states for some set of objects, they
should have access to some set of attributes on a second set of objects.
IE group admins should have rscwo on all other objects.</p>
<p>We can then run these tests and determine if this is or isn't the case.
For example, if we wrote two test cases for the above to test that
&quot;self has rscwo to all attributes or self except sn which should be
rsc&quot; and a second test &quot;self has rscwo to all attributes or self
except cn which should be rsc&quot;. Our test cases would have failed, and
we would be alerted to these issues.</p>
<p>As a result of these tests for our acis I was able to find many more
security issues: Such as users who could self modify groups, self modify
acis, account lockouts of other users, or even turn themselves into a
container object and create children. At the worst one aci actually
allowed objects to edit their own aci's which would have allowed them
to give themself more access potentially. The largest offender were
rules that defined targetattr != rules: Often these were actually
allowing access to write attributes that administrators would over look.</p>
<p>For example, the rule above allowing all write except cn, would actually
allow access to nsAccountLock, nsSizeLimit and other object attributes
that don't show up on first inspection. The complete list is below.
(Note the addition of the '+' )</p>

<p>As a result of unit testing our ldap aci's we were able to find many
many loop holes in our security, and then we were able to
programatically close them all down. Reading the ACI's by hand revealed
some issues, but by testing the &quot;expected&quot; aci versus actual behaviour
highlighted our edge cases and the complex interactions of LDAP systems.</p>
<p>I will clean up and publish the usl tool set in the future to help other
people test their own LDAP secuity controls.</p>
