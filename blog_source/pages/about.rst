I'm William (Firstyear), a software engineer in Brisbane, Australia. I'm part of the `389 Directory Server <http://www.port389.org>`_ team. I'm always happy to talk LDAP and programming, and am very happy to help out with your issues and queries.

I can be contacted about entries on my blog at william at blackhats dot net dot au. You can also find me on Freenode's IRC network in #389 as wibrown or firstyear. If there is anything you would like to see on this blog, I'd be happy to hear from you.

Happy reading!
